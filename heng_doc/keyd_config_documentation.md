Of course\! Here is the updated documentation for your working `keyd` configuration.

I've restructured it to be clearer, added the crucial information about `Caps Lock` also acting as `Control`, and included a better command for applying changes.

# keyd Configuration Documentation

This document summarizes the `keyd` configuration that transforms your **Caps Lock** key into a multi-function "super key". ðŸš€

-----

## Configuration File Location

The primary `keyd` configuration file is located at:
`/etc/keyd/default.conf`

-----

## How to Apply Changes

After modifying the configuration file, you must reload the `keyd` service for the changes to take effect. The recommended command is `reload`, as it applies changes without fully stopping the service.

```bash
sudo keyd reload
```

Alternatively, you can use `restart`:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart keyd
```

-----

## Core Functionality

This configuration gives the **Caps Lock** key three distinct behaviors:

1.  **Tap (Escape):** When you tap (press and release quickly), it functions as the **`Escape`** key. This is perfect for closing dialogs or leaving modes in editors like Neovim.

2.  **Hold + Custom Key (Layer Mode):** When you hold it down and press one of the specially configured keys (like `h, j, k, l`), it activates your custom shortcuts for navigation, media, and more.

3.  **Hold + Other Key (Control Mode):** When you hold it down and press **any other standard key** (like `c, v, t, w`), it acts exactly like the **`Control`** key. This allows you to perform standard operations like `Caps Lock + c` for Copy without moving your hand to the actual `Ctrl` key.
