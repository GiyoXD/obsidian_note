after playing the game on the bed for 1 hour straight at night 8:59 PM, I realize that my time has passed only left me with regret and sorrow, I didn't feel anything good from doing it. Instead, I just feel more worse than I started it. I thing that I want the most is the ability to learn anything, I think tomorrow I will start leearning and not playing any game. 

I should pick up book after finish working.

## Important note here
reminder is really a powerful tool for recall the task I haven't completed, I should use it more.
Recalling task shouldn't be difficult anymore when It only take 5 second to record them. 

## learning Chinese
Just start learn and forget about the thing I should do before learning, it doesn't help much only holding me back. 

## Conversation Skill Improvement
Practice, get advice, practice, note, this is the only conventional tool we have in our assets, other method is great but without starting point we only stuck in the same place, ask question from expert when get stuck, it the hard way I learned from playing game stuck in an area where lore is the give clue about how to proceed the game, don't forget to read them.
